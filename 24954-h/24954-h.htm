    </p>
    <p>
      Crossing from Holyhead to Ireland one night the captain of the steamer and
      myself, during an hour's talk on the bridge, found that we each had sailed
      in a certain Australian coasting steamer more than twenty years before&mdash;he
      as chief officer and I as passenger; and her shipwreck one Christmas Eye
      (long after), which was attended by an appalling loss of life, led us to
      talk of &ldquo;pig-headed&rdquo; skippers generally. His experiences were large, and
      some of his stories were terrible even to hear, others were grotesquely
      humorous, and the memory of that particularly pleasant passage across a
      sea as smooth as a mill pond, has impelled me to retell some of the
      incidents I related to him of my own adventures with obstinate,
      self-willed, or incapable captains.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first experience was with a gentleman of the &ldquo;incapable&rdquo; variety, and
      befell me when I was quite a lad. I had taken my passage in a very smart
      little Sydney (N.S.W.) barque bound for Samoa <i>via</i> the Friendly
      Islands. She was commanded by a Captain Rosser, who had sailed her for
      nearly twenty years in the South Sea trade, and who was justly regarded as
      the <i>doyen</i> of island skippers. He was a &ldquo;Bluenose,&rdquo; stood six feet
      two in his stockinged feet, and was a man of the most determined courage,
      unflinching resolution, and was widely known and respected by the white
      traders and the natives all over the South Pacific.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those days there was quite a fleet of vessels engaged in the South Sea
      trade, and most of them were owned in, and sailed from Sydney, and I could
      have secured a passage in any one of three other vessels, but preferred
      the <i>Rimitara</i> (so I will call her), merely because the agent had
      told me that no other passengers were going by her. Captain Rosser himself
      frankly told me that he did not like passengers, but when he learned that
      I had been to sea before, and intended settling in Samoa as a trader, his
      grim visage relaxed, and he growled something about my finding the
      accommodation ample enough, as I was to be the only passenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Rimitara</i> was lying off Garden Island, and as she was to sail at
      eleven in the morning I went on board at ten with the captain himself.
      Just ahead of the barque was a very handsome brigantine, also bound for
      the Friendly Islands. She had been launched only a few weeks previously,
      and had been built for His Majesty King George of Tonga, at a cost of
      £4,000, as a combined cargo and despatch vessel. As Rosser and I stepped
      on the barque's poop the captain of the brigantine&mdash;whose decks were
      crowded with visitors&mdash;hailed the former and challenged him to a
      race.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, race with yourself, sir,&rdquo; was Rosser's abrupt reply, as he bade his
      chief mate heave up, and then seeing that a number of ladies were standing
      beside the captain of the brigantine, he raised his hat, and added more
      good-humouredly that although the <i>Rimitara</i> was not a yacht like the
      <i>Tuitoga</i>, he would bet the captain of the latter ten pounds that the
      barque would be at anchor in Nukualofa Harbour forty-eight hours before
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make it fifty,&rdquo; cried the master of the new ship, amid the cheers of his
      guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosser shook his head, and replied with apparent unconcern (though he was
      really angry) that ten pounds was enough for any one to lose. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he
      added, &ldquo;don't think I'm going to race you. I'm just going to dodder along
      as usual.&rdquo; (He kept his word most thoroughly.)
    </p>
    <p>
      We got underway first, and were just passing out between Sydney Heads
      under easy sail, when the brigantine overtook us, and passed us like a
      race-horse galloping past a trotting donkey. She presented a beautiful
      sight as she swept by with yards braced up sharp to a good south-east
      breeze, and every stitch of her brand-new canvas drawing. One of the
      officers had the bad manners to take up a coil of small line, and make a
      pretence of heaving it to us for a tow rope. Rosser looked on with an
      unmoved face, though our own mate made some strong remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess it's that champagne he's drunk,&rdquo; was all that Rosser said as he
      turned away, and I have no doubt he was right, for we afterwards learned
      that nearly every one aft on board the brigantine was half-drunk when she
      lifted anchor, the visitors having brought on board half a dozen cases of
      champagne&mdash;as a matter of fact we had seen the steward opening
      bottles on the poop. In an hour the <i>Tuitoga</i> was a long way ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosser said to us at dinner&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That brigantine will come to grief. She's overmasted, and the fellow who
      has her ought not to be trusted with her. He's going to make a mess of
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then in his slow, drawling manner, he told us that the command of the <i>Tuitoga</i>
      had been given to an ex-lieutenant of the navy, whose knowledge of sailing
      vessels was confined to his youthful experiences on one of the service
      training brigs; but King George of Tonga was anxious to secure an English
      naval officer to command the new ship, and out of some hundreds of eager
      applicants, Lieutenant Raye had been selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      By sundown the brigantine was hull down ahead of us, though the barque was
      a very smart vessel, and we were then making eleven knots. At midnight, I
      heard the mate give orders to take in royals and topgallant sails, and
      going on deck, found the wind had almost died away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosser was on deck, and told me that we were &ldquo;going to get it hot from the
      N.E. before long;&rdquo; and by four in the morning we were under topsails and
      lower courses only, the ship flying before a most unpleasant sea. I turned
      in again, and slept till daylight, when the second mate gave me a call.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on deck and see something pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;something pretty&rdquo; was the brigantine, which was in sight about a mile
      away on our lee bow. She was in a terrible mess. Her fore and main royal
      masts and topgallant masts and jibboom had apparently all been carried
      away together, and she was almost lying on her beam ends. We ran down to
      her, and saw that her crew were busy in cutting away the spars and sails
      alongside. All her boats were gone, and her for'ard deck house had
      started, and was working to and fro with every sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      In less than half an hour the mate and six hands from the barque were on
      board, assisting the crew, cutting away the wire rigging and trimming the
      cargo, the shifting of which had nearly sent her to the bottom. I went
      with the boat to lend a hand, and the second mate of the brigantine told
      me that the young captain had refused to listen to the mate's suggestion
      to shorten sail, when the officer told him that the wind would certainly
      come away suddenly from the N.E. The consequence was that a furious squall
      took her aback, and had not the jibboom&mdash;and then the upper spars&mdash;carried
      away under the terrific strain, she would have gone to the bottom. The
      worst part of the business was that two poor seamen had been lost
      overboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a pretty kind of man for a skipper if you like,&rdquo; said the second
      officer bitterly. &ldquo;He ought to be hanged for pretending he's a sailorman.
      It's sheer murder to put such a jackass in command of a deep-water sailing
      ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After rendering all possible assistance to the brigantine, we left her
      about mid-day; and had been lying at anchor for two weeks in Nukualofa
      Harbour before she put in an appearance outside the reef. A native pilot
      went out in a canoe, but the captain haughtily declined his services, and
      would not even let him come on board&mdash;he wanted to show people that
      although he had never seen Naknalofa Harbour before, he could bring his
      ship in without a pilot. In less than half an hour, a swirling eddy caught
      the vessel, and earned her broadside on to the reef, where she would have
      been battered to pieces, had not our two boats gone to her assistance, and
      with great difficulty got her off again. Captain Rosser several times
      countermanded orders given by his chief officer&mdash;an experienced
      seaman&mdash;and bullied and &ldquo;jawed&rdquo; his crew in the most pompous and
      irritating manner, and finally when we succeeded in getting the vessel off
      the reef with the loss of her false keel and rudder, and were towing her
      into smooth water inside the reef, he came for'ard, and abruptly desired
      our chief mate to cease towing, as he meant to anchor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anchor, and be hanged to you,&rdquo; replied our officer with angry contempt;
      &ldquo;the kind of ship you ought to command is one that is towed by a horse
      along a path in the old country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We cast off and left him to his own conceit and devices. He let go in less
      than five fathoms, paid out too much cable, and went stern first on to a
      coral patch, where he stuck for a couple of days, much to our delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within six months this gentleman succeeded in getting the brigantine
      ashore on four occasions, and she had to return to Sydney to be repaired
      at a cost of £1,700.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      My next two experiences were with the pig-headed type. I had made an
      agreement with the master of a Fiji-owned vessel&mdash;also a brigantine&mdash;to
      convey myself and my stock of trade goods from an island in the Tokelau or
      Union Group (South Pacific) to Yap, in the Caroline Islands in the
      North-west, where I intended starting a trading business. This captain was
      as good a seaman as ever trod a deck, and had had a rather long experience
      of the island trade, but a mule could not surpass him in obstinacy, as I
      was soon to learn, to my sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week after leaving the Tokelaus, we dropped anchor on the edge of the
      reef of one of the Gilbert Group, to land supplies for a trader living
      there. The coast was very exposed to all but an easterly wind, and neither
      the mate nor myself liked the idea of anchoring at all. The skipper,
      however, brought his vessel close in to the roaring breakers on the reef,
      let go his anchor in six fathoms, and then neatly backed astern into blue
      water sixty fathoms deep. Here we lay apparently safe enough, for the
      time, the wind being easterly and steady.
    </p>
    <p>
      By sunset we had finished landing stores and shipping cargo, and when the
      captain came off in the last boat, we naturally expected him to heave up
      and get out of such a dangerous place, but to our surprise he remarked
      carelessly that as the men were very tired, he would hold on until
      daylight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't risk it if I were you,&rdquo; said the trader, who had come aboard
      in his own boat to &ldquo;square up.&rdquo; &ldquo;You can't depend on this easterly breeze
      holding all night, and it may come on squally from the west or south-west
      in a few hours, and take you unawares.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Hoist the boats up, Mr. Laird, and tell the men to
      get supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; replied the mate, none too cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as the trader was going ashore, he said to me aside, quietly, &ldquo;This
      little monkey-faced skipper is a blazing idiot&rdquo; (our captain was a very,
      very little man). &ldquo;I told him again just now, that if the wind comes away
      from west or south-west, or even if it falls calm, he'll find he's caught,
      to a dead certainty. But he as good as told me to mind my own business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Naturally enough I was anxious. I had on board trade goods which had cost
      £1,100, and of course had not one penny of insurance on them. The
      brigantine, however, was well insured, though I do not impute this fact as
      being the cause of the captain's neglect of a sensible warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper, the captain turned in, while the mate and I, both feeling
      very uneasy, paced the deck till about nine o'clock, at which hour the
      wind had become perceptibly lighter, and the captain was called. He came
      on deck, trotted up and down in his pyjamas for a few minutes, sat on the
      rail, like a monkey on a fence, and then asked the mate snappishly what he
      was &ldquo;scared about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mate made no reply, and the captain was just going below again, when
      two fishing canoes, with four natives in each, came quite near us, both
      heading for the shore; and the skipper asked me to hail them and see if
      they had any fish to sell. I did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;we are going back again, because much rain and wind
      is coming from the westward, and we want to get over the reef before the
      surf becomes too great.&rdquo; Then one of them stood up and added&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why does not the ship go away quickly. This is a very bad place here when
      the wind and the sea come from the west. Your ship will be broken to
      pieces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do they say?&rdquo; inquired the little man.
    </p>
    <p>
      I translated what they had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bosh, I say again,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;the glass has been as steady as a
      rock for the past three days,&rdquo; and then, to my intense anger, he added an
      insinuation that my fears had led me to deliberately misinterpret what the
      natives had said. The retort I made was of so practical a nature that the
      mate had to assist the skipper to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quarter of an hour later, as the mate and I still walked the deck,
      discussing the captain's shortcomings, the wind died away suddenly, and
      then several of our native crew came aft, and said that a squall was
      coming up from the westward, and the mate, though neither he nor myself
      could then see any sign of it, went below and again called the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came on deck, with one hand covering his injured left optic, told me he
      would settle with me in the morning, and then took a long look astern, and
      there, certainly enough, was a long streak of black rising over the
      horizon. The mate stood by waiting his orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not coming near us,&rdquo; said the little man more snappishly than ever,
      as he marched up and down the poop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say it is,&rdquo; said Laird bluntly, &ldquo;and I consider this ship will be
      ashore, if we don't slip and tow out a bit before it is too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mate's manner had some effect on the obstinate little animal&mdash;&ldquo;Oh,
      well, if there's such a lot of old women on board, I'll give in. Call the
      hands, and we'll heave up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heave up!&rdquo; echoed the mate in angry astonishment, &ldquo;what's the use of
      trying to heave up now! That squall will be on us in ten minutes, and if
      we had an hour to spare, it would be none too long. Why, man, it's a dead
      calm, and the swell will send us into the surf on the reef quick enough
      without our dragging the ship into it. Reckon the best and only thing we
      can do, is down boats, and then slip cable right-away. We might get a show
      then to lay along the reef, and get clear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not going to lose a new cable and anchor to please any one,&rdquo; was the
      stupid reply. (He could very easily have recovered both anchor and cable
      with the assistance of the natives on the following day, or indeed months
      after.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he sang out to the men to man the windlass.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hands, realising the danger, turned to with a will, but within five
      minutes the first breath of the squall caught us, and sent us ahead, as
      was evident by the way the slackened cable came in through the hawsepipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had out fifty-five fathoms of chain, and before twenty-five were in,
      the squall was upon us properly; the brigantine went gracefully ahead,
      overran her anchor, plunged into the roaring breakers on the reef, and
      struck bows on.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another moment or two a heavy sea caught her on the starboard quarter,
      canted her round, and dashed her broadside on to the reef with terrific
      violence. Then, fortunately for our lives, two or three further rollers
      sent her crashing along till she brought up against two or three coral
      boulders, whose tops were revealed every now and then by the backwash. In
      less than twenty minutes she was hopelessly bilged, and her decks swept by
      every sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      We carried three boats, and our native sailors showed their pluck and
      skill by actually getting all three safely into the water, two on the lee
      side, and one on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain, now conscious of his folly, became very modest, and gave his
      orders quietly. The crew, however, took no notice of him and looked to the
      mate. He (the captain) ordered me into the first boat, in which were the
      ship's papers, charts, chronometer, &amp;c. I refused, and said I
      preferred getting on shore in my own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had seen that two native boys (passengers) had run out on to the
      bowsprit, and, watching their chance, had dropped over into a curling
      roller, and were carried safely ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had with me on board about nine hundred silver Mexican and Chili dollars&mdash;some
      in a cash box, the rest in a bag. Calling my native servant, Levi, I asked
      him if he thought all the boats would get ashore safely. He shook his
      head, said that it was doubtful, and that it would be better for me to
      throw the bag and the cash box over the lee side, where they were pretty
      sure to be recovered in the morning at low tide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the boats will capsize, or get stove in, going over the reef, or else
      will be smashed to bits on the shore,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the natives will
      steal everything they can lay their hands on, especially if the white men
      are drowned. So it is better to throw the money overboard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took his advice, and going on deck, we dropped both box and bag
      overboard, just where Levi pointed out a big boulder, against which the
      brigantine was crushing and pounding her quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again refusing to enter any of the boats, I watched my chance, and ran
      for'ard, followed by Levi, and as soon as a big roller came along, we
      dropped, and were carried ashore beautifully. Some hundreds of natives and
      the white trader were on the look out, and ran in and caught us before the
      backwash carried us out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mate's boat had already reached the shore without accident, owing to
      the splendid manner in which he and his native crew had handled her; but
      both the captain and second mate came to grief, their boats broaching to
      and capsizing just as they were within a few fathoms of the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, no lives were lost, and although next morning the brigantine's
      decks had worked out of her and came ashore, the hull held together for
      some weeks, and we saved a lot of stores. My money I recovered two or
      three days later, though it had been carried more than a hundred yards
      away from the spot where it had been dropped overboard. The tin cashbox
      (which I had tied up in an oilskin coat, parcelled round with spun yarn,
      and weighted inside with several hundred Snider cartridges) was found
      buried in sand and broken coral, in a small pool on the reef; it presented
      a most curious appearance, being almost round in shape. The canvas bag was
      found near by, under a ledge of the reef, together with the binnacle bell&mdash;which
      was doubled flat&mdash;and a dinner plate! The bag (of No 2 canvas) had
      been hastily rolled up by Levi in the cabin table-cloth, weighted with all
      the loose Snider cartridges we could find in the darkened trade room, and
      tied up at each end like a &ldquo;roly-poly.&rdquo; This proved its salvation, for
      when we dug it out (under three fathoms of water) the outer covering came
      away in fine shreds, and some of the big Mexican sun dollars had cut
      through the canvas.

    <p>
      So ended my second experience, and the only satisfactory thing about it to
      me, after losing over a thousand pounds worth of goods through the
      captain's obstinacy, was that when he was fussing about after the wreck
      trying to get one of the anchors ashore, he managed to lose his right
      forefinger. I regret to say that whilst I dressed the stump and bound up
      his hand for him, I could not help telling him that I was sorry it was not
      his head that had been knocked off&mdash;previous to our going ashore.
      'Twas very unchristianlike, but I was very sore with the man for his
      pig-headedness, and then he so bewailed the loss of his finger; never
      thinking of the fact that the boatswain had all but lost an eye, but had
      never even murmured at his hard luck.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      My third experience of a &ldquo;pig-headed&rdquo; master mariner, followed very
      quickly&mdash;so quickly, that I began to think some evil star attended my
      fortunes, or rather misfortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      After living on the island for three months, after the loss of the
      brigantine, two vessels arrived on the same day&mdash;one, a schooner
      belonging to San Francisco, and bound to that port; the other, the <i>George
      Noble</i>, a fine handsome barquentine, bound to Sydney. Now, it would
      have suited me very well to go to California in the schooner, but finding
      that the skipper of the wrecked brigantine had arranged for passages for
      himself, officers and crew in her, I decided to-go to Sydney in the <i>George
      Noble</i>, purely because the little man with the missing finger had
      become so objectionable to me&mdash;brooding over my losses, and wondering
      how I could pay my debts&mdash;that I felt I could not possibly remain at
      close quarters with the man in a small schooner without taking a thousand
      pounds worth of damage out of him during the voyage, which &ldquo;taking out&rdquo;
       process might land me in a gaol with two years imprisonment to serve. So I
      bade goodbye to good mate Laird, and the boatswain with the injured eye,
      and the native crew who had acted so gallantly; and then with Levi
      standing by my side, holding my ponderous bag of my beloved Mexican
      dollars in one hand, and a few articles of clothing in the other, I told
      Captain &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; that I considered him to be an anthropoid
      ape, an old washerwoman, and a person who should be generally despised and
      rejected by all people, even those of the dullest intellects, such as
      those of the members of the firm who employed him. And then recalling to
      my memory the sarcastic remark of the mate of the <i>Rimitara</i>, to the
      pompous captain of the <i>Tuitoga</i> about the command of a canal boat, I
      wound up by adding that he had missed his vocation in life, and instead of
      being skipper of a smart brigantine, he was intended by Providence to be
      captain of a mud-dredge, for which position, however, he had probably
      barely sufficient intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling very despondent&mdash;for I had but nine hundred Mexican and
      Chilian dollars to meet a debt of eleven hundred pounds, and had out of
      this to keep myself and servant for perhaps six months until I got another
      start as a trader, I went on board the <i>George Noble</i> and bargained
      with her captain for a passage to Sydney, at which port I knew I could at
      once meet with an engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain of the <i>George Noble</i> was a very decent and good-natured
      German, named Evers. He agreed to take me and my henchman to Sydney for
      125 dollars&mdash;I to live aft, the boy to go for'ard with the sailors,
      and lend a hand in working the ship, if called upon in an emergency. The
      vessel, I found, was owned by a firm of Chinese merchants in Sydney, and
      carried a Chinese supercargo, but he was the only Celestial on board, the
      firm only employing him on account of their having so many Chinese traders
      throughout the equatorial islands of the Pacific.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had not been long on board the <i>George Noble</i> when I discovered
      that Evers, who was a fine sailorman and a good navigator as well, was one
      of the &ldquo;pig-headed&rdquo; kind. His mate, second mate, and carpenter, were
      Britishers, as were nearly all the crew, but they and the skipper could
      not agree. There was no open rupture&mdash;but Evers had the idea that
      both his officers and men disliked him because he was a &ldquo;Dutchman.&rdquo;
       Perhaps this was so, but if it was, the officers and men never showed
      their dislike at being commanded by a foreigner&mdash;they knew he was a
      good seaman, and gave him unvarying respect and obedience. Nevertheless,
      Captain Evers never spoke a friendly word to any one of his officers, and
      when he had to speak to them, he did so in such a manner of strained
      politeness and severity, that it was really unpleasant to hear him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On our way to Sydney we called at various islands of the Gilbert Group,
      and finally went into Apaian Lagoon, where the barquentine had to load one
      hundred tons of copra (dried coco-nut). During the time I had been on
      board, Evers and myself had become very intimate, and, I am glad to say,
      through me, he and his officers became quite friendly with each other. And
      we all spent many happy evenings together. But I could see that Evers was
      extremely jealous of his second mate's reputation as a South Sea pilot,
      and he would very often purposely question him as to the entrance of such
      and such a passage of such and such an island, and then deliberately
      contradict his officer's plain and truthful statements, and tell him he
      was wrong. Foster, a good-humoured old fellow, would merely laugh and
      change the subject, though he well knew that Captain Evers had had very
      little experience of the navigation of the South Seas, and relied upon his
      charts more than upon his local knowledge&mdash;he would never take a
      suggestion from his officers, both of whom were old &ldquo;island&rdquo; men&mdash;especially
      the second mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      We loaded the hundred tons of copra, and were ready for sea by nine
      o'clock one morning, when a number of large sailing canoes came off,
      crowded with natives from a distant part of the island, all anxious to buy
      firearms and ammunition in view of a great expedition against the adjacent
      island of Tarawa. They all possessed either plenty of money or copra, and
      Evers did a remarkably good, though illegal business, and sold them over a
      hundred rifles. By the time they had finished, however, it was past one
      o'clock, and I concluded that we could not leave the lagoon till the
      following morning. To my surprise, and the second mate's open-mouthed
      astonishment, the skipper, who was highly elated with his morning's
      trading, told the mate to clear the decks, and get ready to heave up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he's mad!&rdquo; said the second officer to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I must explain: Apaian Lagoon is a vast atoll completely enclosed on
      the eastern and southern sides by a low, narrow strip of land, densely
      covered with coco-palms, and on the northern and western by a continuous
      chain of tiny islets connected by the reef. On the western side there are
      two narrow ship passages, both exceedingly dangerous on account of their
      being studded with numerous coral &ldquo;mushrooms&rdquo;&mdash;i.e., enormous
      boulders of coral rock, which, resembling a mushroom in shape, come to
      within a few feet of the surface of the water. Through these passages, the
      tide, especially the ebb, rushes with great velocity&mdash;six or seven
      knots at least&mdash;and vessels when leaving the lagoon, generally waited
      till slack water, or the first of the flood, when with the usual strong
      south-east trades, they could stem the current and avoid the dangerous
      &ldquo;mushrooms.&rdquo; But no shipmaster would ever attempt either of these
      passages, except in the morning, when the sun was astern, and he could,
      from aloft, con the ship. After two or three o'clock, the sun would be
      directly in his face, and render it almost impossible for him to get
      through without striking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here then was the position when Evers, cheerfully smoking a cigar, and
      smiling all over his handsome face, gave the order to heave up. It was
      blowing very strongly, the tide was on the ebb, the sun was directly in
      our faces, and we were to tear through a narrow passage at racehorse speed
      without being able to see anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ventured to suggest to him that it was a bit late for us to get under
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it. Come along with me up on the foreyard, and you'll see
      how the <i>George Noble</i> will skip through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We certainly did skip, for before the anchor was secured, we were dashing
      westwards for the passage at eight or nine knots, and Evers kept calling
      out to the mate to make more sail. By the time we were abreast of the
      passage, the <i>George Noble</i> had every stitch of her canvas on her,
      and was fairly &ldquo;humming&rdquo; along at nearly thirteen knots over the smooth
      water, and then when she spun into the narrow passage through which a
      seven-knot current was tearing, her speed became terrific, and I held my
      breath. The second mate and boatswain were at the wheel, and the crew were
      standing by the braces. The silence on board was almost painful, for the
      terrible roar of the current as it tore along the coral walls of the
      passage, deadened every sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Starboard a little,&rdquo; shouted Evers to a sailor stationed in the fore
      rigging below us, who repeated the order to a man on the rail, who in turn
      passed the word aft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady, there, steady!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I tried in vain to discern anything ahead of us&mdash;the blinding,
      blazing sun prevented my seeing aught but a mad seething swirl of water
      just beneath our bows, and on each side of us. Evers, however, seemed very
      confident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll be through in another two minutes&mdash;&rdquo; he began, and then came a
      terrific shock, and both he and I were jerked off the footrope, and
      toppled over the yard on to the bellying foresail!
    </p>
    <p>
      We both rolled down on top of the windlass, and landed almost in each
      others arms, half dazed. I sat down on deck to consider who I was, and
      what was the matter, and Evers made a wobbly run aft, the ship still
      ripping along, for we had been checked in our mad career for a second or
      two only.
    </p>
    <p>
      In two or three minutes we were outside, and clear of danger, and Evers,
      now much subdued, brought to under the lee of the reef, and anchored. Then
      we lowered a boat, and made an examination of the ship for'ard. Nothing
      was wrong with her above her water-line, but three feet further down her
      stem was smashed into a pulp, and bits of timber kept coming to the
      surface every now and then. An hour later we had nine inches of water in
      the hold, and the consequence of Evers's pig-headedness was that we had to
      keep the pumps going day and night, every two hours, till we rigged a
      windmill, which was kept going till we reached Sydney.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six months later, the local trader of Apaian wrote to me, and told me that
      Evers &ldquo;has improved the passage into the lagoon very much. You ran smack
      into a big mushroom, standing up right in the middle, and broke it off
      short, about fifteen feet below the surface. Hope the <i>George Noble</i>
      will do the same thing next time.&rdquo;
